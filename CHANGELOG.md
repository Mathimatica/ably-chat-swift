## [0.1.0](https://github.com/ably/ably-chat-swift/tree/0.1.0)

Initial release of the Ably Chat SDK in Swift. It includes the following chat features:

- Chat rooms for 1:1, 1:many, many:1 and many:many participation.
- Sending and receiving chat messages.
- Online status aka presence of chat participants.
- Chat room occupancy, i.e., total number of connections and presence members.
- Typing indicators
- Room-level reactions (ephemeral at this stage - reactions are sent and received in real-time without persistence)
