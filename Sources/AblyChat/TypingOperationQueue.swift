/// Implemements the CHA-T14 queueing behaviour for ``DefaultTyping``'s `keystroke()` and `stop()` operations.
///
/// Accepts requests to perform an operation via ``enqueue(operation:)``. Depending on the queue's current state, this operation may be performed immediately, or the request may be enqueued to be performed later, in which case it might end up being replaced via a later `enqueue(â€¦)` call. See documentation for that method for more details.

/// - Note: The naming of this class is a bit tricky: `OperationQueue` already has a meaning in Foundation, and this has nothing to do with that. But "operation" seems a better word than "task", which has a specific meaning in Swift concurrency. So we choose what seems like the lesser of two evils.
