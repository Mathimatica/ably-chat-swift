# Contributing

## Requirements

- The Xcode version [mentioned in the README](./README.md#requirements)
- [Mint](https://github.com/yonaskolb/Mint) package manager
- Node.js (any recent version should be fine)

## Setup

1. `mint bootstrap` — this will take quite a long time (~5 minutes on my machine) the first time you run it
2. `npm install`

## Running the tests

Either:

- `swift test`, or
- open `AblyChat.xcworkspace` in Xcode and test the `AblyChat` scheme

## Linting

To check formatting and code quality, run `swift run BuildTool lint`. Run with `--fix` to first automatically fix things where possible.

## Development guidelines

- The aim of the [example app](README.md#example-app) is that it demonstrate all of the core functionality of the SDK. So if you add a new feature, try to add something to the example app to demonstrate this feature.
- We should aim to make it easy for consumers of the SDK to be able to mock out the SDK in the tests for their own code. A couple of things that will aid with this:
  - Describe the SDK’s functionality via protocols (when doing so would still be sufficiently idiomatic to Swift).
  - When defining a `struct` that is emitted by the public API of the library, make sure to define a public memberwise initializer so that users can create one to be emitted by their mocks. (There is no way to make Swift’s autogenerated memberwise initializer public, so you will need to write one yourself. In Xcode, you can do this by clicking at the start of the type declaration and doing Editor → Refactor → Generate Memberwise Initializer.)

### Testing guidelines

#### Exposing test-only APIs

When writing unit tests, there are times that we need to access internal state of a type. To enable this, we might expose this state at an `internal` access level so that it can be used by the unit tests. However, we want to make it clear that this state is being exposed _purely_ for the purposes of testing that class, and that it should not be used by other components of the SDK.

So, when writing an API which has `internal` access level purely to enable it to be called by the tests, prefix this API’s name with `testOnly_`. For example:

```swift
private nonisolated let realtime: RealtimeClient

#if DEBUG
    internal nonisolated var testsOnly_realtime: RealtimeClient {
        realtime
    }
#endif
```

A couple of notes:

- Using a naming convention will allow us to verify that APIs marked `testsOnly` are not being used inside the SDK; we’ll do this in #70.
- I believe that we should be able to eliminate the boilerplate of re-exposing a `private` member as a `testsOnly` member (as exemplified above) using a macro (called e.g. `@ExposedToTests`), but my level of experience with macros is insufficient to be confident about being able to do this quickly, so have deferred it to #71.
